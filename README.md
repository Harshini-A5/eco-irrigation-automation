Mini-Project Report: Enhancing Community Services through Digital Solutions
Project Title :
ABSTRACT:

Watering plants is a vital yet labor-intensive task in greenhouse operations. The “ ECHO- WATER EFFICIENT PLANT IRRIGATION SYSTEM” simplifies this process by automating irrigation through various methods like sprinklers and tubes.
Many people love nurturing plants but struggle to keep them healthy due to time constraints. Our prototype enhances plant self-sufficiency by allowing them to water themselves from a large tank and providing artificial sunlight.
It monitors plant conditions and reminds users to refill the water tank. This system helps users care for their plants more easily, allowing them to enjoy the benefits of gardening without the worry of forgetting to water.

 INTRODUCTION :
The project's main goal is to automate plant watering using an Arduino Uno. This system allows plants to receive water while the owner is on vacation, reducing the need to rely on neighbors.
Automated irrigation helps grow crops, maintain landscapes, and restore dry areas. When activated, water flows through pipes to drip irrigation heads.
Sprinklers with threaded inlets connect easily to pipes and are installed flush with the ground. Drip irrigation minimizes water loss, lowers labor costs, and boosts yields.
The system reads sensor data, converting analog signals to digital through the controller. It displays motor status on an LCD panel and serial monitor.
Many irrigation systems save water for different crops, ranging from basic to advanced technologies. For example, one system schedules irrigation based on soil temperature and moisture content.
 
 
 Tools and Raw Materials :
	ARDUINO:
Open-source microcontroller platform that allows users to create interactive electronic projects by programming and controlling physical devices.
	MOISTURE SENSOR:
Device that measures the water content in soil, providing data on soil moisture levels to help determine when irrigation is needed, commonly used in automated watering systems.
	WATER PUMP:
Mechanical device used to move water from one location to another, often utilized in irrigation systems to supply water to plants or fields as needed.
	RELAY:
Electromechanical switch that allows a low-power signal from a microcontroller to control a higher-power circuit, commonly used to activate or deactivate devices like motors and pumps in automation systems.

6.2	Conclusions:
Thus the “ECHO-WATER EFFICIENT PLANT IRRIGATION SYZSTEM” has been
designed and tested successfully. It has been developed by integrated features of all the hardware components used. Presence of every module has been reasoned out and placed carefully, thus contributing to the best working of the unit. Thus, the Arduino Based Automatic Plant Watering System has been designed and tested successfully. The system has been tested to function automatically. The moisture sensors measure the moisture We are highly obliged to our college “RTC Institute of Technology, Ranchi” that provided a healthy environment to move us to accomplish our goals. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Prof. Rajkumar Mistri our guide and head of department of Electronics & Communication Engineering for his guidance and support, which contributed to the successful completion of this project
